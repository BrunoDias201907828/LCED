

- Data correctness

Check for errors and inconsistencies in the data; no errors found I think (see in frequency of values and distribution)

- Missing values examination

How are missing values represented? Blanks
Get missing values count by column and row
Why is it missing? Data entry error maybe
Evaluate the impact of missing values

Data quality metrics: missing values percentage

- Checking for distinct values by column

"Cod_do_Material" (PK) has only 9268 distinct in 9290 entries so remove duplicates
When duplicate, keep row with more completeness

'NIVEL_REND_EFICIENCIA_-_EFF','NUMERO_DE_FASES' and 'PROCESSO_FABRICACAO' have only 1 distinct value.
Not enough variability -> drop columns

Columns with 2 distinct values  may become boolean or binary

- Frequency of values

Use also to look for inconsistencies or errors
When in a column some values appear only once create a cluster "others" for these values

- Missing values solution

After dropping these rows and columns we still have * missing values so how do we deal with them?
Give possible solutions: delete rows, imputation(replace by avg, etc)

- Analysis?

Perform analysis like variance, average, min, max, distribution, correlation...
